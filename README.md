BOILED-Egg Model Predictor
Welcome to the BOILED-Egg Model Predictor repository. This project provides a comprehensive tool for predicting gastrointestinal absorption (GIA) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration based on molecular properties derived from the BOILED-Egg model. The project is implemented in Python and uses RDKit for cheminformatics and Shapely for geometric analysis.

Project Overview
The BOILED-Egg model, developed by Daina and Zoete in 2016, is a widely recognized method for predicting the absorption and distribution of drugs within the human body based on molecular properties. This tool allows users to upload molecular structure data files in .sdf format, process the molecular data, and output predictions of GIA and BBB penetration.

Key Features
Molecular Descriptor Calculation:

Topological Polar Surface Area (TPSA): Calculated using RDKit's Descriptors.TPSA, considering the contributions from sulfur and phosphorus atoms.
Wildman and Crippen LogP (WLogP): Representing molecular lipophilicity, also calculated using RDKit.
Geometrical Analysis:

The tool defines specific regions in the TPSA vs WLogP space as ellipses, representing areas where molecules are likely to exhibit good GIA or BBB penetration.
These regions are defined using the Polygon class from shapely.geometry.
Data Handling:

Users can upload multiple .sdf files, each containing a series of molecular structures.
For each molecule, TPSA and WLogP are calculated, and it is determined whether the molecule falls within the predefined GIA or BBB regions.
Output:

A CSV file summarizing the molecular properties and their classification concerning GIA/BBB regions.
A scatter plot visualizing the TPSA-WLogP space, with the GIA and BBB regions overlaid. The plot is saved as both PDF and PNG files.
Installation
Clone the Repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BOILED-Egg-Model-Predictor.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:
bash
Copy code
cd BOILED-Egg-Model-Predictor
Install the Required Dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
The primary dependencies include:
RDKit: For molecular descriptor calculations.
Shapely: For geometric analysis.
Pandas: For data handling.
Matplotlib: For plotting.
Usage
Upload .SDF Files:
The tool allows you to upload one or more .sdf files containing molecular structures.

Run the Script:
To execute the model, simply run the provided script:

bash
Copy code
python pyBOILEDegg.py
This will process the uploaded .sdf files and generate the output files.

Output Files:

CSV File: A file with the suffix _BOILED_Egg.csv will be created for each input file. This file contains the calculated TPSA and WLogP values, along with the GIA and BBB predictions.
Scatter Plot: A plot showing the molecular data points within the TPSA-WLogP space, overlaid with the GIA and BBB ellipses, will be saved as both PDF and PNG files.
Example
Hereâ€™s an example of the expected output:

Input: example_molecules.sdf
Output:
example_molecules_BOILED_Egg.csv
example_molecules_BOILED_Egg_plot.pdf
example_molecules_BOILED_Egg_plot.png
The scatter plot illustrates the position of each molecule in the TPSA-WLogP space, making it easy to visualize their absorption and distribution potential.
